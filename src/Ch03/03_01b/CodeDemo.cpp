//structures are just basically data containers and classes are used when u dont only need to hold data but also act on it 
//also the members of a struct are public by default unlike classes 

struct cow{
    //kinda attributes in a class

    int age;
    cow_purpose purpose;

};

int main(){

    std::cout << my_cow.name << " is a type-" << (int) my_cow.purpose << " cow." << std::endl;
